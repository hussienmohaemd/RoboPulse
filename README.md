# RoboPulse: EMG-Based AI System for Robotic Arm Control

## Project Description

RoboPulse is an advanced Electromyography (EMG) based AI system designed to empower researchers and engineers with tools to leverage EMG signals for medical applications. By integrating a variety of AI techniques, RoboPulse facilitates the analysis and classification of EMG data, enabling control of robotic arms or other devices. The project combines comprehensive data handling, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization capabilities, making it an invaluable resource for innovation in medical robotics.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Classification (`classifiers.py`)**: Implements several machine learning models, including SVM, KNN, MLP, LDA, and Logistic Regression, to classify EMG signals effectively.
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing Tools**:
  - **Filtering (`filters.py`)**: Applies advanced filtering techniques, such as bandpass filtering and wavelet decomposition, to clean and prepare EMG signals for analysis.
  - **Normalization (`normalization.py`)**: Standardizes EMG data, ensuring consistent and reliable input for machine learning models.
  - **Signal Segmentation (`sagmetation.py`)**: Divides continuous EMG data into meaningful segments for more precise analysis.
- **Feature Extraction (`featureExt.py`)**: Extracts critical features from EMG signals, enabling more accurate classification and analysis.
- **Data Handling (`loadData.py`)**: Loads and processes datasets in multiple formats, with customizable options for data segmentation and filtering.
- **Visualization Tools (`dataVisulization.py`)**: Provides utilities for visualizing EMG signals, feature distributions, and classification results to enhance interpretability.
- **Application Control (`application.py`)**: Integrates the system with real-world applications, such as controlling a robotic arm based on classified EMG signals.
- **Customizable Pipelines (`processing.py`)**: Supports the creation of tailored processing pipelines, combining various preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification steps.
- **Utility Libraries (`libraries.py`)**: Includes supporting functions and utilities used across different modules in the system.

    filtered_data = fb.apply_filters(raw_emg_data)

    from normalization import Normalizer
    norm_data = Normalizer.standardize(filtered_data)
    ```

- **Feature Extraction (`featureExt.py`)**:

    ```python
    from featureExt import FeatureExtractor
    features = FeatureExtractor.extract_features(norm_data)
    ```

- **Model Training and Evaluation (`classifiers.py`)**:

    ```python
    from classifiers import train_model
    model, accuracy = train_model(features, labels)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')
    ```
